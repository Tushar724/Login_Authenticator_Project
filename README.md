1. We created a Login authenticator project in which we took the username and password from the user and used that data to login .
2. Worked on the SQL connectivity with the python using the my sql connector library through which we imported the files and used it to establish a connection between the database and python file
3. Developed an application using the tkinter library and developing buttons for the data entry.
4. Saved data on the SQL Server through which the machine can accept the username or password when the user wants to login. 
5. Worked on backend such as establishing connection and frontend to develop an interface for the application.
